With increasing popularity in fashion, streetwear, figurines, etc. a culture has fromed, focusing on collecting items like sneakers, literal bricks, crowbars and much more. Typically these items that are released, sell out very quickly and resell for more than their retail price. Websites such as StockX and GOAT are well known for promoting the resale of such items and keeping up with the majority of all popular limited releases, allowing users to buy and sell items.

By this means, these websites are referenced by the vast majority of collectors, resellers and buyers as these websites serve as a basis to identify the market value of an item as they contain information regarding an item's lowest ask, last sold price and highest bid, to name a few. 

However, to determine the value of an item, it must be searched individually on each platform. Clearly, this can be a significantly time consuming process if it is done regularly, and often it is. Not to mention that items can be forgotten and users, shops, etc., can have hundreds or even thousands of these items. To resolve this issue, UNO was designed to allow users to enter an unlimited amount of items and have their corresponding market values (from StockX and GOAT) and other data all in one place.
